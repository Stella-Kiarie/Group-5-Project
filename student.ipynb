    "## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "The entertainment industry is rapidly evolving as major companies produce original content for streaming platforms. To remain competitive, our company aims to enter the film production market. Understanding which types of movies perform best is critical to making informed investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem\n",
    "The company plans to launch a new movie studio but lacks insight into what types of films perform best at the box office. This project aims to explore current movie trends to guide the studio in making data-driven decisions about what films to produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "This project uses data from Box Office Mojo (for movie revenues) and IMDB (for ratings and movie characteristics) to perform exploratory data analysis. The goal is to identify patterns, correlations, and factors that contribute to movie success and translate findings into actionable business recommendations.\n",

    "### Objectives \n",
    "1. To identify high-performing movie genres.  \n",
    "2. To Evaluate the impact of audience ratings on box office performance.  \n",
    "3. To identify key factors that predict movie success (e.g., genre, runtime, release timing).  \n",
    "4. To examine how box office performance changes over time."
